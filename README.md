# Lending Club Case Study 

Lending Club is a marketplace for personal loans that matches borrowers who are seeking a 
loan with investors looking to lend money and make a return. 

## Goals of data analysis:  

When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for 
loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a 
loss of business to the company

If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, 
then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, 
i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. 
The company can utilize this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.
